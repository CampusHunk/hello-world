This repository serves as a resource for mastering the GitHub Flow, marking Day 1 of the 30 Days of Coding challenge. 
It's day 2 and I haven't written any code istead, I watched a github tutorial "Github for Poets", about what is "Git and Github".


********************************************************************

In the realm of bytes and bits they dwell,
Data types, in their forms, do tell,
Integers, floats, strings so fine,
Boolean values, a binary line.

From the smallest to the grand,
Each a purpose, each a stand,
Bytes of data, structured right,
In the world of code, a guiding light.

Strong and strict, or loose and free,
Defined constraints for all to see,
Choices made with care and thought,
In data types, a language wrought.

So in the code, let data flow,
Types defined, to make it glow,
A tale of values, clear and true,
In every line, a type to construe.
